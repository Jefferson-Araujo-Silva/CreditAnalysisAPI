# CreditAnalysisAPI

An API made for my learning at Jazz Tech, appling my knowledge with Spring framework, Java 17.
This API is made to analyze credit card credit limits for customers who have been registered in our system.
I analyse this condition using my other API that registers new customers and their addresses (https://github.com/Jefferson-Araujo-Silva/ProjetoApiJazz)
